## Assignment summary

I decided to use Firebase, because it ideally fits the scope of the project and is a quick & free hosting solution. This React app uses Firebase Authentication (Magic Link) and Firestore to persist user scores. The app fetches real-time Bitcoin prices from the CoinCap API every minute. The user has to register in order to make bets.
